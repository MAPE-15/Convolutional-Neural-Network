# Neural Network From Sctrach
Do not expect this neural network to be as precise as from the frameworks.
This neural network is programmed from scratch, to understand how it works.
This neural network is trained to recognize facial expressions and to classify each.

## Facial Expressions:
- angry
- disgust
- fear
- happy
- neutral
- sad
- surprise

## Data
Data is saved in the ./data/ directory.  
Data is separated into training set and validation - testing set.  
Training set is in the ./data/test/ directory.  
Validation - testing set is in the ./data/test/ directory

Data consists of images 48x48. In each image is a person, more specifically, person's face. This person's face has a specific facial expression.
